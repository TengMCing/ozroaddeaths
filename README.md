ozroaddeaths [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ropenscilabs/ozroaddeaths.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ropenscilabs/ozroaddeaths) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/ropenscilabs/ozroaddeaths?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ropenscilabs/ozroaddeaths)
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

ozroaddeaths is a package that pulls data from the Australian Road Deaths Database, run by the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (BITRE). This provides basic details of road transport crash fatalities in Australia as reported by the police each month to the State and Territory road safety authorities. The details provided in the database fall into two groups:

1.  The circumstances of the crash, for example, date, location, crash type

2.  Some details regarding the persons killed, for example, age, gender and road user group.

Installation
------------

You can install ozroaddeaths from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/ozroaddeaths")
```

This data is taken from the Australian Road Deaths Database, which provides basic details of road transport crash fatalities in Australia as reported by the police each month to the State and Territory road safety authorities, obtained from: <https://bitre.gov.au/statistics/safety/fatal_road_crash_database.aspx>

Details provided in the database fall into two groups:

-   the circumstances of the crash, for example, date, location, crash type

-   some details regarding the persons killed, for example, age, gender and road user group.

The fatality data is updated every month. The heavy vehicle flags (for articulated truck, heavy rigid truck and bus involvement) are only updated each quarter, and are current to within two months. Information for heavy rigid truck involvement in crashes earlier than 2004 is incomplete.

Package Author's Notes
